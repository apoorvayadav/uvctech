      <p>The UV-C LED Anti-Bacterial Door Knob Band was developed in response to the emerging issues around student health in dormitories
        and student housing as they can become a cesspool for infectious disease in the winter months.
        Although the technology was developed for student housing, there are numerous markets that would benefit for the implementation
        of the UV-C-LED Anti-Bacterial Door Knob Band.
        <br>
        <br>
        If made an industry standard in health care facilities, the UV-C-LED Anti-Bacterial Door Knob Band will significantly decrease the likelihood of invasive infections in all health care facilities while also limiting the use of harmful cleaning chemicals. The UV-C-LED Anti-Bacterial Door Knob Band uses 5 LEDâ€™s to emit UV-C light to break the chemical bonds in the surface bacteria to eliminate surface transfers. The silicone on the surface of the Band is medical grade to ensure superior quality. The UV-C-LED Anti-Bacterial Door Knob Band comes in universal sizes or can be stretched to fit if necessary.</p>
